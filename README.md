# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains end-to-end machine learning project notebooks implemented using Python. The projects demonstrate practical application of machine learning concepts from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Notebooks

- **ML-Project.ipynb**  
  Covers the complete machine learning workflow including data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

- **ml-project n2.ipynb**  
  An extended version of the machine learning project with additional experiments, improved preprocessing, model tuning, and performance comparison.

## Key Concepts
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and testing  
- Model evaluation and comparison  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Purpose
To gain hands-on experience in building, improving, and evaluating machine learning models using real-world workflows.
